## Hologram simulation

The holograms are simulated from bright-field microscopy images that are labeled and saved as ROI. A sample of the dataset can be find in `dataset/train`.  The full dataset (In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System) is open source and can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/datasciencebowl/data)
